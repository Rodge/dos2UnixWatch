# watcher4dos2unix
Watch a file and have it dos2unix'ed on changes (e.g. csv files from WebNodes / Relatude), which lets you `grep`, `less` and `tail -f` ahead. 

More options and convenience will be added later 4sure, e.g. auto-choosing the latest file in a specified folder (handy for WebNodes logs).
